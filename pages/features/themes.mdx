# Themes

Nextra itself is basically a plugin that normalizes your Markdown routes in Next.js into structural data, and it doesn't handle any styling related thing. A **theme** is what renders your actual pages, it works like a layout component in React.

Nextra has 2 official themes that you can use:

- [Docs Theme](/themes/docs)
- [Blog Theme](/themes/blog)

You can also extend your own themes. Here's a great starter example by [@jaredpalmer](https://github.com/jaredpalmer):
