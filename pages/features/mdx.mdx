# MDX

With Nextra, all your `.md` and `.mdx` files under the pages directory will be rendered with [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/about), it's an
advanced Markdown format with React component support.

You can use import and use React components inside your Markdown files like this:

```markdown
import Callout from 'nextra-theme-docs/callout'

**Markdown With React Components**

<Callout emoji="✅">
  **MDX** (the library), at its core, transforms MDX (the syntax) to JSX.
  It receives an MDX string and outputs a _JSX string_. It does this by parsing
  the MDX document to a syntax tree and then generates a JSX document from that tree. 
</Callout>
```

Generates:

import Callout from 'nextra-theme-docs/callout'

<div className="p-4 border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-900 rounded mt-6">

## Syntax Highlighting

Automatic syntax highlighting:

````markdown
```js
console.log('hello, world')
```
````

Renders:

```js
console.log('hello, world')
```

You can also add the `highlight=<line|range>` modifier to highlight specific lines:

````markdown
```jsx highlight=4,6-8
import useSWR from 'swr'

function Profile() {
  const { data, error } = useSWR('/api/user', fetcher)

  if (error) return <div>failed to load</div>
  if (!data) return <div>loading...</div>
  return <div>hello {data.name}!</div>
}
```
````

```jsx highlight=4,6-8
import useSWR from 'swr'

function Profile() {
  const { data, error } = useSWR('/api/user', fetcher)

  if (error) return <div>failed to load</div>
  if (!data) return <div>loading...</div>
  return <div>hello {data.name}!</div>
}
```

## Inline Code

You can use \`content\` to wrap inline code content like: `let x = 1`.

## Blockquote

```
