# Detecting if the user is on the wrong network

<Callout>
  The content on this site is based off of version `0.2.28` of `wagmi`. The
  `0.3.0` version release brought in tons of breaking API changes. The content
  on this site has not been updated to be compatible with it yet.

You can easily detect if the user is on the wrong network using the `useNetwork` hook from `wagmi`.

```tsx
import { useNetwork } from 'wagmi'

const Page = () => {
  const [{ data, error, loading }] = useNetwork()

  // checks if the user is not on mainnet. 1 => mainnet's chain ID. See https://chainlist.org/ for other chains
  const wrongNetwork = data.chain?.id !== 1

  return <div>{wrongNetwork && <p>You are on the wrong network!</p>}</div>
}
```
