# Wallet connections

[create-web3-frontend](https://github.com/dhaiwat10/create-web3-frontend) already does this for you.

You have two options. 

1. Use [Rainbowkit](https://www.rainbowkit.com) (recommended, fastest and prettiest), or
2. If you want to make a 'custom' wallet connection interface, refer the [wallet connection guide in the wagmi docs](https://wagmi.sh/examples/connect-wallet)
