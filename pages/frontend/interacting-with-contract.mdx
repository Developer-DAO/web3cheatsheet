The most straight-forward way to interact with a smart contract is to use the `useContract` hook from `wagmi`.

```tsx
import { useContract } from 'wagmi'

const Page = () => {
  const contract = useContract({
    addressOrName: 'your_contracts_address',
    abi: your_contracts_abi,
  })

  // Reading from the contract
  const readGreeting = async () => {
    const greeting = await contract.greeting()
    console.log(`Greeting: ${greeting}`)
  }

  // Writing to the contract
  const setGreeting = async () => {
    const tx = await contract.setGreeting('Hello world')
    const response = await tx.wait()
    console.log(`Transaction response: ${response}`)
  }
}
```
