# Project setup

This cheatsheet is based around projects using React, TypeScript and [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh).

### Quick start

The quickest way to get started with a new fully-setup project is to use [create-web3-frontend](https://github.com/dhaiwat10/create-web3-frontend).

```bash
$ npx create-web3-frontend --ts my-app
```
