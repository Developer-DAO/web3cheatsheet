# Project setup

<Callout>
  The content on this site is based off of version `0.2.28` of `wagmi`. The
  `0.3.0` version release brought in tons of breaking API changes. The content
  on this site has not been updated to be compatible with it yet.

This cheatsheet is based around projects using React, TypeScript and [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh).

### Quick start

The quickest way to get started with a new fully-setup project is to use [create-web3-frontend](https://github.com/dhaiwat10/create-web3-frontend).

```bash
$ npx create-web3-frontend --ts my-app
```
