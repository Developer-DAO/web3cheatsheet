# Signing a message

<Callout>
  The content on this site is based off of version `0.2.28` of `wagmi`. The
  `0.3.0` version release brought in tons of breaking API changes. The content
  on this site has not been updated to be compatible with it yet.
</Callout>

We make use of the `useSignMessage` hook from `wagmi` to sign messages.

```tsx
import { useSignMessage } from 'wagmi'

const Page = () => {
  const [_, signMessage] = useSignMessage()

  const onClick = async () => {
    const { data, error } = signMessage({ message: 'gm' })
    console.log(`Signed message: ${data}`)
  }

  return <button onClick={onClick}>Sign Message</button>
}
```
