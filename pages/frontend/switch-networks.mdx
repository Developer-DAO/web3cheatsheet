# Switching networks

<Callout>
  The content on this site is based off of version `0.2.28` of `wagmi`. The
  `0.3.0` version release brought in tons of breaking API changes. The content
  on this site has not been updated to be compatible with it yet.
</Callout>

We make use of the `useNetwork` hook from `wagmi` to switch networks.

```tsx
import { useNetwork } from 'wagmi'

const Page = () => {
  const [{ data, error, loading }, switchNetwork] = useNetwork()
  const currentChainId = data.chain?.id

  // 1 => mainnet's chain ID. For other networks, see https://chainlist.org
  const desiredChainId = 1

  return (
    <div>
      {currentChainId !== desiredNetworkChainId && (
        <button onClick={() => switchNetwork(desiredChainId)}>
          Switch to mainnet
        </button>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```
