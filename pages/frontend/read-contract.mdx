# Reading from a smart contract

We make use of the `useContractRead` hook from `wagmi` to read from a smart contract.

```tsx
import { useContractRead } from 'wagmi'

const Page = () => {
  const [{ data, error, loading }, read] = useContractRead(
    {
      addressOrName: 'your_contracts_address',
      abi: your_contracts_abi,
    },
    'the_contract_method_name'
  )
}
```

For example, if you want to read the `greeting` from a `Greeter` contract:

```tsx
import { useContractRead } from 'wagmi'

const Page = () => {
  const [{ data, error, loading }, read] = useContractRead(
    {
      addressOrName: 'greeter_address',
      abi: Greeter_ABI,
    },
    'greeting'
  )

  return <p>Greeting: {data}</p>
}
```

---

If you want to programtically read instead of reading on page load, you can use the `read` function directly:

```tsx
import { useContractRead } from 'wagmi'

const Page = () => {
  const [_, read] = useContractRead(
    {
      addressOrName: 'greeter_address',
      abi: Greeter_ABI,
    },
    'greeting'
  )

  const handleClick = async () => {
    const { data } = read()
    console.log(`Greeting: ${data}`)
  }

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Read greeting</button>
}
```
