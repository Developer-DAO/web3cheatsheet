  The content on this site is based off of version `0.2.28` of `wagmi`. The
  `0.3.0` version release brought in tons of breaking API changes. The content
  on this site has not been updated to be compatible with it yet.
</Callout>

We make use of the `useContractWrite` hook from `wagmi` to read from a smart contract.

```tsx
import { useContractWrite } from 'wagmi'

const Page = () => {
  const [{ data, error, loading }, write] = useContractWrite(
    {
      addressOrName: 'your_contracts_address',
      abi: your_contracts_abi,
    },
    'the_contract_method_name'
  )
}
```

For example, if you want to set the `greeting` i.e. call `setGreeting` for a `Greeter` contract:

```tsx
import { useContractWrite } from 'wagmi'

const Page = () => {
  const [{ data, error, loading }, write] = useContractWrite(
    {
      addressOrName: 'greeter_address',
      abi: Greeter_ABI,
    },
    'setGreeting'
  )

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => write('Hello, world!')}>Set greeting</button>
    </>
  )
}
```
